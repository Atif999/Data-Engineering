## Running the docker

To get started run ``` docker-compose up ``` in root directory.
It will create the PostgresSQL database and start generating the data.
It will create an empty MySQL database.
It will launch the analytics.py script. 

Your task will be to write the ETL script inside the analytics/analytics.py file.

You can use the command "docker-compose up --build" also in the root directory to run with changes if you already have the the container docker.
